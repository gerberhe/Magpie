Activity 1 using Elbot

Exploation Questions:
1. It tells me that it comes from a well-stocked
wardware store
2. It told me it could go away, so I typed "go
away", and it actually left.
3. Sometimes it just redirects the conversation
and asks a question about me.
4. It asked me this: "You really created a mess of 
confusion switching all those colors around. What
color would pretzels be?"

Questions:
1. Some of these are "you, me, understand, hello",
etc. He looks for symbols I think, like question
marks and periods.
2. "You" - Usually associates this with some sort
of question about himself
"Me" - Usually asks a question about me when this
word comes up
